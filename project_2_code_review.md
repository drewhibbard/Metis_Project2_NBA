## Clean Code:

- Code follows PEP-8
- Very readable and easy to follow
- Great job using python functions for web scraping and including docstrings at the beginning to help the reader understand the inputs and purpose of these functions
- In future projects, try to create functions and py files for your modeling process like you did for scraping

## Good Documentation:

- Good & informative README.md. Create a results section and mention your findings/discovers from the project. 
- Markdown cell at beginning of .ipynb explains scope and analyis
- Could use more markdown cells throughout as section headings 
- Good job explaining your thought processes through inline coding

## Proper Data Science:

- Love the approach/project design of the project. 
- Great understanding of when to use time series applications
- Feature creation- days rest and players average and rolling 3 and 7 games scores were innovative. Loved this thought process!!
- Feature engineering-after boot camp would love to see if you can do more feature interactions.


## Comments:

- Good job on project 2! :)
- I hope this helps you make a lot of money! lol
